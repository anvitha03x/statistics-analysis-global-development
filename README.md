# **Data Analysis on Global Development Indicators**

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on **analyzing global development indicators** using the **Gapminder dataset**. The analysis includes **data exploration, visualization, and factor analysis** to uncover patterns related to **life expectancy, GDP, CO2 consumption, and Human Development Index (HDI)**.

## **Aim of the Project**  
- Understand **key global development trends** using statistical analysis.  
- Identify factors influencing **economic growth, healthcare, and environmental sustainability**.  
- Utilize **Factor Analysis and other statistical methods** to extract meaningful insights.  

## **Purpose of the Project**  
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Handle missing values and standardize column names.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data distributions and relationships using **Seaborn and Matplotlib**.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Apply techniques like **Factor Analysis, Regression, and ANOVA** to detect key influencing factors.  
- **Predictive Insights:** Use **machine learning techniques** to model development trends.  

## **Key Findings & Insights**  
- Strong correlations exist between **GDP, life expectancy, and HDI**.  
- **CO2 consumption** shows significant variations based on economic development levels.  
- Factor analysis helped reduce dimensions and identify **underlying influences on development trends**.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)  
- **Factor Analysis & Statistical Methods**  
- **Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis**  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **More advanced machine learning models** for predicting development trends.  
- **Real-time data integration** for up-to-date insights.  
- **Interactive dashboards** for better data visualization.
